# RETRIVA 🎓

**The smart way to find what you've lost on campus.**

RETRIVA takes the stress out of losing personal items. Instead of posting on disorganized social media groups or checking physical lost-and-found boxes, use our AI-powered platform to match lost items with found ones instantly.

### How it Works
1.  **Report it:** Tell us what you lost or found. You can upload a photo, and our AI will automatically describe it for you.
2.  **Get Matched:** We use Google Gemini AI to analyze descriptions and images. If there's a match, we'll tell you immediately.
3.  **Connect:** Chat securely with the other student to arrange a pickup.

### Key Features
*   🤖 **Smart Matching:** The system understands that "MacBook" and "Apple Laptop" are the same thing.
*   🛡️ **Safety First:** We automatically filter out spam, pranks, and inappropriate content to keep the community safe.
*   💬 **Secure Messaging:** Communicate with other students without sharing your personal phone number.
*   ⚖️ **Compare Items:** Not sure if it's yours? View items side-by-side with an AI analysis of the likelihood they match.
